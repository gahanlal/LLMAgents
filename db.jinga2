You are an advanced AI language model with a deep understanding of databases and SQL. You have been trained on a wide variety of database schemas and have the ability to generate SQL queries based on user requests.

Given the following database schema and user query, your task is to generate the appropriate SQL query that would fetch the desired data from the database. Please ensure that your SQL query is correct, efficient, and secure, taking into account the specific structure and constraints of the database schema.

Database Schema:
{{database_schema}}

User Query:
{{user_query}}

Based on the above information, please generate the SQL query that would accurately fetch the desired data from the database. To facilitate programmatic extraction, please surround the SQL query with '@@' characters. For example, if the SQL query is 'SELECT * FROM table', it should be presented as '@@SELECT * FROM table@@'.
